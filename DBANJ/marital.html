      Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo popularly known as D’Banj is a Nigerian artiste,
      songwriter, rapper, entrepreneur, and TV personality. He is also known by
      the nickname – ‘Koko Master’ or ‘Bangalee’.
      <br /><br />
      D’Banj ventured into music in 2005 when the music industry was just
      blossoming in Nigeria. Since he started his career as a musician, he has
      made a lot of achievements and has gained recognition globally.
      <br /><br />
      The ‘Koko Master’ as he is fondly called by his fans is the founder of the
      Koko Foundation for Youth and Peace Development. He is also the first
      Nigerian to be named the United Nations Youth Ambassador for Peace. Apart
      from being a successful artiste, he is a husband and father of two
      children.
      <br /><br />
      D’Banj is married to Lineo Didi Kilgrow. His marriage to Kilgrow was
      secretive until December 2017 during the Supremacy Concert, where he
      introduced her and his late son Daniel Oyebanjo III to the audience.
      <br /><br />
      The concert marked his first public appearance in a year as he had taken
      time off to start a family with Kilgrow.
      <br /><br />
      D’Banj revealed in an interview with BEAT FM that he had kept his
      relationship with his wife secretive to avoid complications from media
      hypes and speculations.
      <br /><br />
      Moreover, he wouldn’t have married Kilgrow if not for his mother who
      convinced him that Kilgrow was the right girl for him.
      <br /><br />
      D’Banj and Kilgrow have two children together (a boy and a girl). Their
      first son drowned in a swimming pool in 2018.
      <br /><br />
      D’Banj had a secretive wedding with his wife Lineo Didi Kilgrow on 2nd
      June 2016 at Maryland Lagos. The wedding was a small ceremony graced by
      the closest relatives and friends of the couple.
      <br /><br />
      Some of those who attended the ceremony thought they were attending a
      birthday party for D’Banj’s father.
