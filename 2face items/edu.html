      Innocent Ujah Idibia was born in Jos, Nigeria. He is from the Idoma ethnic
      group in the southern part of Benue State, in central Nigeria.[10] He
      attended Mount Saint Gabriel's Secondary School in Makurdi, Benue State.
      <br />
      Tuface enrolled at the Institute of Management & Technology, Enugu (IMT),
      where he did his preliminary National Diploma course in Business
      Administration and management.
      <br />
      While attending IMT, Idibia performed at school organised shows and
      parties, as well as other regional schools such as the University of
      Nigeria and Enugu State University of Science & Technology.
      <br />
      He eventually dropped out of school to pursue his music career. While
      attending IMT, 2face Idibia started composing and singing jingles at the
      GB Fan Club at Enugu State Broadcasting Services (ESBS) in 1996. Also in
      1996, he adopted the stage name "2Face" (Tuface).
      <br />
      He cited the reason as "trying to demarcate my personal life with my
      business life".[11] In 2016, he officially changed his name from Tuface to
      2Baba.[12]
